# Hash-Tables
As a first own task within the STROUPO-group my own implementation of a very simple hash-table (and thereby working myself back into C++ again) shall be created here. 

## Tasks 
*   Implement Hash-table with "linear probing" and open-adressing 
*   Test with simple/cheap hash-function: identity or bit-reversal -> do not focus on hash-function itself (=ignore)
*   Eg map-test: integer->integer (too cheap) or string->integer 
*   Hash-map needs 3 important functions
    *   Insert 
    *   Find 
    *   Delete -> lazy vs direct 
*   finally: test implementation! ... but a good test is difficult 

## Workflow Hints
*   For test processes -> g++ -o main main.cpp 
*   Refactoring/improvement -> buildfile etc 

## Solution
will follow

## Sources
*   General facts about [Hash-tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table)
